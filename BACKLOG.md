# Portfolio — Backlog

## Phase 0 — Tech stack inventory

- [ ] Compile complete, coherent tech stack list from CV:
      **Languages:** Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, PHP, Ruby, C++, Java, Perl
      **Frontend:** React, HTML5/CSS3, WordPress
      **Backend:** Node.js, Flask/Django, Rails, REST APIs
      **Databases:** MySQL/PostgreSQL, MongoDB
      **DevOps:** Docker, CI/CD (GitHub Actions), Linux/LAMP, AWS, DigitalOcean
      **Automation:** Selenium, Playwright, Claude/Anthropic API
      **Tools:** Git, Jira, Claude Code, VS Code
      **PM/Agile:** Certified PM, CSM (Scrum Master), 25+ yrs experience
- [ ] Choose a format: badges, table, or grouped list
- [ ] Evaluate GitHub Pro: private repos + Actions minutes + Pages — is it worth it?

## Phase 0.5 — Photos

- [ ] Get proper professional photos taken (or find best existing ones)
      — Headshot: clean background, good lighting, professional but approachable
      — Action/working shot: at desk, coding setup, natural
- [ ] Check existing photos: KUVA - Jussi Hagström.png in ~/Desktop/cv/ — is it good enough?
- [ ] Use same photo consistently: portfolio, LinkedIn, GitHub, CV
- [ ] Optional: short video intro for portfolio landing page

## Phase 1 — Profile polish

- [ ] Update portfolio bio/tagline to match CV headline
- [ ] Ensure contact info is consistent: portfolio ↔ LinkedIn ↔ GitHub ↔ CV
- [ ] Add "Open to Work" signal on portfolio landing page
- [ ] Add links: GitHub, LinkedIn, CV download

## Phase 2 — Projects showcase

- [ ] Decide which projects to feature (candidates: jobfinder, formfiller, linkedin_tool, scripts, historic_games)
- [ ] Write 2–3 sentence case studies per featured project
- [ ] Add live demo links or screenshots for each
- [ ] Archive or hide incomplete/old projects from public view (python_pong removed — already private)

### Side project / curiosity — AI vs AI Pong
- [ ] Build a Pong variant where two AIs play each other
      — Simple ball-tracking AI to start, then improve each "player" independently
      — Could use different AI strategies: rule-based, reinforcement learning, Claude API
      — Embed as a live demo or GIF on the portfolio — fun, memorable, shows initiative
      — Frame it as a curiosity: "What happens when two AIs compete?"
- [ ] Tech: Python + pygame (or JS canvas for web embed)
- [ ] Keep it lightweight — the point is the concept, not a production game

## Phase 3 — CV page

- [ ] Add CV/Resume page or PDF download
- [ ] Consider role-tailored CV variants (dev, PM, consultant)

## Phase 4 — Ongoing

- [ ] Keep tech stack page in sync with new skills
- [ ] Add new project after each significant delivery
